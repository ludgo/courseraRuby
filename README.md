# courseraRuby

This is a series of repos for [Ruby on Rails Web Development Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ruby-on-rails) by [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), which I completed independently, with passing grade, without pursuing a verified certificate. Obviously, it does not make me an expert at the field, but I got at least sense how things work.
